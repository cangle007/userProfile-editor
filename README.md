# Afero's Profile Editor
The design below is a real feature that shipped with Aferoâ€™s Profile Editor and the Afero mobile apps. It requires dynamic layout of controls based on a view style property. While the mobile app loads and presents the model, the Afero Profile Editor allows developers to define the model. This includes configuring the layout and a preview of how it would appear in the mobile app.
